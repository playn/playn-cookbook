# PlayN Cookbook

This project contains a bunch of simple examples of common techniques used when developing video
games. Each example is a separate project and tries to focus on demonstrating a single technique.
Because PlayN projects can run on HTML5 web browsers, each project is compiled into a running
example which is embedded in the web page that discusses the technique in question.

The current entries are enumerated below, grouped into broad categories.

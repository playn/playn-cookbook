    <h1>Drifting Snow</h1>
    <p>
      This recipe shows how to use the TriplePlay particle system to simulate snowflakes drifting
      down the screen, with random "wind" that blows them about. Note: the TriplePlay particle
      system requires WebGL and therefor so does this recipe.

    <h3>Live Demo</h3>
    <div id="playn-root" style="width: 800px; height: 400px"></div>

    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> None - just sit back and relax </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Source Code</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/threerings/playn-cookbook/blob/master/effects/snow/core/src/main/java/cookbook/snow/core/Snow.java">Snow.java</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exercises</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Make the rotation vary for different particles. You probably don't want to compute a
        sin/cos for every single particle, but you could compute five or six of them and assign
        them to particles based on their index. </li>
      <li> Make the "wind" vary for different particles. Either choose a different velocity scale
        factory based on the particle's current y position, or some other differentiating
        factor. </li>
    </ul>
